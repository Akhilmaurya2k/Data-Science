## 📌 Classification Approaches
1️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Predicts the class of an input image based on the closest neighbors.
2️⃣ Logistic Regression
   - Uses probabilistic classification to determine the most likely digit.
3️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Implements a hyperplane-based classification approach.
4️⃣ Decision Tree
   - Constructs a tree-based model to classify digits.
5️⃣ Random Forest
   - An ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.

## 📊 Results
- Allows users to select different models and see classification results instantly.
- Provides an intuitive UI for easy interaction.
