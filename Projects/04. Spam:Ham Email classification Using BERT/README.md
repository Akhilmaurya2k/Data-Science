# 📩 Spam/Ham Classification Using BERT  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **spam detection model** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. The model classifies text messages as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)** with high accuracy. The project leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** and **deep learning** to enhance email and SMS filtering systems.  

## ❗ Problem Statement  
With the increasing volume of unsolicited messages, distinguishing between **spam** and **legitimate (ham) messages** has become crucial for digital communication. Traditional spam filters often rely on keyword-based detection, which leads to false positives and negatives. This project aims to leverage **BERT**, a powerful deep-learning-based NLP model, to accurately classify text messages and improve filtering mechanisms.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- 🏆 **State-of-the-art Text Classification** – Uses BERT for accurate spam detection.  
- 🔎 **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Cleans and tokenizes text data for training.  
- 📊 **Fine-tuned BERT Model** – Utilizes a pre-trained transformer to classify spam and ham messages.  
- 📉 **Performance Evaluation** – Analyzes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (BERT)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Model Evaluation)  
- **Torch/TensorFlow** (Deep Learning)  

## 📊 Results  
- Model achieves **high accuracy and F1-score**, making it effective for real-world spam detection.  
- Supports further fine-tuning and deployment in applications like email filtering and chatbot moderation.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Experiment with **other transformer models** (e.g., DistilBERT, RoBERTa).  
- Deploy as a **real-time API** for SMS/email classification.  
- Enhance dataset size and diversity for better generalization.
