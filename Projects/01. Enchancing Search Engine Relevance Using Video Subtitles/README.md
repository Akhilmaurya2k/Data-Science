# 🎬 Cine Shazam – Subtitle-Based Video Search Engine  

## 🚀 Overview  
Cine Shazam is an advanced search engine that enhances search relevance for video subtitles. Inspired by Shazam, it allows users to identify movies, TV shows, or web series by analyzing recorded dialogue and retrieving the most relevant subtitles. This project utilizes **natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ensure accurate results.  

## 🎯 Features  
- 🎤 **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe recorded audio.  
- 🔍 **Semantic Search Engine**: Implements **vector-based retrieval** for precise subtitle matching.  
- 📊 **ChromaDB for Vector Storage**: Stores and retrieves subtitle embeddings efficiently.  
- 🧠 **OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo for Contextual Understanding**: Extracts relevant information from retrieved subtitles.  
- 📄 **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.
