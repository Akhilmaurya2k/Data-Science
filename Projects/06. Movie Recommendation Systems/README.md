# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using three different approaches:  
1. **Content-Based Filtering**  
2. **Collaborative Filtering**  
3. **Popularity-Based Recommendation**  

The system is built using Python, Streamlit, and various machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## ❗ Problem Statement
With the vast number of movies available, it becomes overwhelming for users to choose what to watch next. A good recommendation system helps users discover movies based on their preferences, viewing history, or popular trends.

## 🛠️ Features
🏆 **Multiple Recommendation Techniques** – Content-based, Collaborative, and Popularity-based filtering.  
🔎 **Interactive UI** – Built with Streamlit for an easy and intuitive user experience.  
📊 **Pre-trained Models** – Uses precomputed similarity matrices for fast recommendations.  
📉 **Efficient Performance** – Optimized retrieval and display of recommended movies.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (Web App)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pickle** (Model Storage)
- **PIL** (Image Processing)

## 📌 Recommendation Approaches
### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering  
- Analyzes movie metadata (e.g., genre, director, cast) to find similar movies.  
- Uses a precomputed similarity matrix for fast lookup.  

### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering  
- Based on user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, watch history).  
- Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity detection.  

### 3️⃣ Popularity-Based Recommendation  
- Recommends top-rated or most popular movies based on ratings and votes.  

## 📊 Results
- Provides personalized recommendations using machine learning models.  
- Supports real-time interaction with instant movie suggestions.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrate **Hybrid Recommendation Systems** (combining multiple techniques).  
- Deploy as a **real-time API** for broader integration.  
- Improve model accuracy with larger, more diverse datasets.
